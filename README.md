NEURAL NETWORK LIBRARY - LEVENBERG MARQUARDT OPTIMIZATION

 Optimization techniques have extensively been utilized to find solutions related to linear and nonlinear system in mathematical problems. It is useful to provide optimization algorithm when solving unmodeled dynamics especially in control theory/system dynamics.
 
 On the other hand, Neural network structure has been reached to utmost topic for solving/creating dynamic model design in data science. NN efficiency is also increased with general microprocessor speed.
 
 In theory, NN establishes the input-output relation with the rule of training which is backpropagation algorithm. However, BP algorithm is slow in contrast with its stability. Due to these reason, BP algorithm is redesigned with Newton-Gaussian methods which is called Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. In LM algorithm, each coefficient is updated for a given error value, not a total cost one! So, it gives a way to create faster learning algorithm.
 
 For the whole reasons, simple Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is presented to fix these issues on both computer and microprocessor structures!
 
 In this GitHub file, LM optimization technique is applied on the feedforward neural network structure.
 
 I hope it is useful for you :)
